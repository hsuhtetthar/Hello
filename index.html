                the best chocolate cake recipe
                Chocolate flavour oozes all through this cake even though it’s only made with cocoa powder, like our very own Fudgy Chocolate Cake. With a crumb so incredibly tender, this cake stays moist for a good 4-5 days. Whether you eat it plain, dust it with powdered sugar or serve with dollops of cream or scoops of ice cream, it truly is perfectly perfect!
                
                Of course, smothering it with a buttercream frosting never hurt anyone.Best Fudgy Chocolate Cake
